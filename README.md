# Keylogger
Just A Simple Keylogger Written In Python Using Keyboard Library

## Issues On Keyboard Lib
- As You Could See Your Can Not Use Replace Or Do Anthing Here On Ketboard Event After Record I Solve This Proplem By Just Change The List Item To Regular String Using ```str()``` Function On Python, I Hope That Will Help You. 

## Notes
- **Required Root Access And You Need Root Access Too To Remove Log File On ' /etc/keys '.**
- **Requires Internet Connection For Send Emails**
- **Change Email Data On Code First Before Turn It Into ELF.**
- **Do Not Forget To ' pip3 install keyboard'**
- **Before Run ' build-elf.sh ' type ' chmod +x build-elf.sh '.**
- **If You Seen ' pyinstaller: command not found ' That Mean Something Happen While Install The Lib Or Wrong BIN Path.**
- **if You Have Not See Any Errors Your Could Run The File On Dist Folder.**
- **Do Not Forget To Edit The Code To Start Send Email Stuff On SendData() Function And Add It To Main Function To Send Data After Collect And Filters**
- **Click ' Esc ' To Stop Record Input And Save Data**
- **Only For Linux Systems**
- **I Have Not Test This Tool Too Much Due Too OS Errors On Ma PC Feel Free To Open An Issue And Tell Me**
- **Use It As You Want.**
